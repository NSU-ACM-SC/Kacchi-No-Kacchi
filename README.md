# Kacchi No Kacchi
> Disclaimer A fun project. Nothing serious.

If there can be hotdog no hotdog, then there can be Kacchi-No-Kacchi as well! 😎 👨🏾‍💻

## Platform?
iOS 11 and above. Basically anything that supports `CoreML`.

# How does it work?
Behind the scenes, a `CoreML Model` does all the job. When you pass an `image` to it either from Phone's `camera` or some image from the `Photo Library`, it runs `inference` on the image and provides the output. `Basically Binary Image Classification`.

## Training the model?
I wrote a post on Medium on this [here](http://bit.ly/2ERKQdX)

The `CoreMLModel` and the images it was trained with can be found in the [releases](https://github.com/ShawonAshraf/Kacchi-No-Kacchi/releases) section of this repo.

## Screenshots?
How about a video demo?
